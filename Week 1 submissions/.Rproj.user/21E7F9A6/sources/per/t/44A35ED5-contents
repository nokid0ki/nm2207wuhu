### Hello!

Roses are <span style="color:red">red</span>, <br> 
violets are <span style="color:blue">blue</span>. <br>
Hello, I am <span style="color:orange">Niki</span>, <br>
Nice to meet <span style="color:purple">you</span>!

I am a Y3 accountancy student :) I enjoy drawing, travelling, and eating good food. I took up this mod to kick start coding!

I recently went to Melbourne with my pals, here are some photos!! My favourite part of the trip was the incredible nature and wildlife. The temperature was great too, it was refreshing to be able to hike without sweating...

```{r picture,out.width= "50%",echo=F,eval=TRUE ,fig.align='center',fig.cap="Lake Zennet along the Great Ocean Road (ft. me haha)"} 
knitr::include_graphics("photo1691418026.jpeg")
```
<br>
```{r image,out.width= "50%",echo=F,eval=TRUE ,fig.align='center',fig.cap="The Puffing Billy train ride"} 
knitr::include_graphics("photo1691530789.jpeg")
```
<br>

My code below :)

```{r pic2,out.width= "50%",echo=F,eval=TRUE} 
knitr::include_graphics("R studio layout 2.png")
```
```{r pic1,out.width= "50%",echo=F,eval=TRUE} 
knitr::include_graphics("R studio layout 3.png")
```
